/*
 * The if expression checks whether our value is out of range, tells the user about the problem, and
 * calls continue to start the next iteration of the loop and ask for another guess. After the if
 * expression, we can proceed with the comparisons between guess and the secret number knowing that
 * guess is between 1 and 100.
 * However, this is not an ideal solution: if it was absolutely critical that the program only operated
 * on values between 1 and 100, and it had many functions with this requirement, having a check like
 * this in every function would be tedious (and might impact performance).
 * Instead, we can make a new type and put the validations in a function to create an instance of the
 * type rather than repeating the validations everywhere. That way, itâ€™s safe for functions to use the
 * new type in their signatures and confidently use the values they receive. Listing 9-13 shows one way
 * to define a Guess type that will only create an instance of Guess if the new function receives a value
 * between 1 and 100.
